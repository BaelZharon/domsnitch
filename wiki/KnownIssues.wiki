==Known issues==

===Issue #1: I tried intercepting eval() and my application did not load properly===

Generally speaking, eval() is not a typical function in the JavaScript world. As part of its magic, eval() is aware of the scope from which it is called. More information on this problem is available [http://radi.r-n-d.org/2011/02/evil-magic-of-eval.html here].


===Issue #2: My application uses applicationCache...===

Due to caching issues, it is not recommended to intercept innerHTML while the application is pulling data from applicationCache. A workaround is currently not available, but it is a work in progress.
